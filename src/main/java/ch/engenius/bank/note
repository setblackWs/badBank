Another improvements that could be done is adding validation service layer, so for example we would have
BankServiceImplementaion and BankServiceValidation. Main benefit of this would be that our implementaion
service would we responsibility to only do business logic and not bothering with validation

Another good improvement would be using one of the loggers(log4j probably) for logging certain events like creating accounts, transferring money etc.
